Natural language processing extracts content from reviews in Yelp's Challenge Database regarding restaurants' dog-friendliness and food quality. Then, scores from 0 (negative) to 1 (positive) are computed based on the sentiment for each category. Dynamic visualizations allow users to seamlessly compare individual restaurants, cities, and states. Restaurants are displayed on an interactive map using the Google Maps and Yelp APIs.
